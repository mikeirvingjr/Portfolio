                            <a href="https://monogame.net">MonoGame</a> is a
                            managed C# framework for developing cross platform
                            games. It works for a multitude of platforms such as
                            Windows,&nbsp;&nbsp;MacOS,&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux,&nbsp;&nbsp;Android,
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;and iOS to name a few. If licensed, it
                            will work for Xbox, PS4 | PS5, and Nintendo Switch
                            consoles.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I first used MonoGame somewhere around 2010-2012
                            where I started porting my old Monopoly C++ code I
                            had written for a Software Engineering class for my
                            Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Back then,
                            the game was written in C++ and OpenGL. MonoGame
                            proved that it was easier to write in C# and let the
                            framework worry about the graphics layer. I was also
                            using the project to learn C#, but that's is for
                            another story.

                            I truly did not start my Unity journey until 2023.
                            Did not seem like it was an engine that I would
                            like. Or so I thought. I love coding in C# and
                            little did I know, the scripting language for this
                            engine is solely that.

                            first Gears of War game released, I was hooked on
                            what the Unreal Engine could do. Not to mention that
                            I was a C++ developer back then.

                            however, with the MONO framework and later .NET6, C#
                            became supported.

                            and v4. This was partly because of Unity's new price
                            structure, and I was also curious in how much time
                            it would take to port a Unity game to Godot.
